## **ABOUT THE PROJECT:**

CodeX is a German beverage company that wants to make its mark in India. A few months ago, they launched their energy drink in 10 cities across the country. The Marketing team is focused on getting people to know the brand, gaining more customers, and developing products that people will love.

To understand what people think, they did a survey in those 10 cities and got responses from 10,000 people. My job as a data analyst is to turn all this information into useful insights that the marketing team can use to improve their plans and make CodeX a success in India.
